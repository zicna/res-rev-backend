Dávila isn’t shy about risks; she isn’t pandering to the typical American diner. This isn’t a place to fill up on chips and salsa with a pitcher of margaritas; Dávila left her previous job after owners tried to force those expectations. That’s not to say there’s not a taste of the familiar with a stellar steak burrito and fried oyster tacos. But customers should dive into unique items like peanut butter rabanos and tlacoyo, the latter which represents Dávila’s obsession with pre-Hispanic Mexico.",
